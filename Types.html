			<ul>
				<li><b>Major Depression: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>If you're experiencing major depression, you may feel and see symptoms of extreme sadness, hopelessness, anhedonia or loss of interest in pleasurable activities, lack of energy, irritability, trouble concentrating, changes in sleep or eating habits, feelings of guilt, physical pain, and thoughts of death or suicide — and for an official diagnosis, your symptoms must last for more than two weeks.</li>
						<li> In some instances, a person might only experience one episode of major depression, but this type of depression tends to recur throughout a person's life.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Seasonal Affective Disorder: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>Though many people find themselves in winter funks, SAD is characterized by symptoms of anxiety, increased irritability, daytime fatigue, and weight gain.</li>
						<li>This type of depression typically occurs in winter climates, likely due to the lack of natural sunlight.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Postpartum Depression: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>It is characterized by feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, loneliness, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, fears about hurting the baby, and feelings of disconnect from the child.</li> 						<li>This depression type can occur anywhere from weeks to months after childbirth, and Halaris says that it almost always develops within a year after a woman has given birth.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>	
				<li><b>Atypical Depression: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>This type of depression is less well understood than major depression.</li>
						<li> Unlike major depression, a common sign of atypical depression is a sense of heaviness in the arms and legs feeling justPeople with this depression type may also gain weight, be irritable, and have relationship problems.</li>
						<li>Other features of atypical depression includes the lack of ability to feel better when something good happens and a long-standing pattern of being extra sensitive to interpersonal rejection.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Dysthymia: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>Dysthymia is a type of depression that causes a low mood over a long period of time — perhaps for a year or more.</li>
						<li>People can function adequately, but not optimally.</li>
						<li>Symptoms include sadness, trouble concentrating, fatigue, and changes in sleep habits and appetite.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Psychotic Depression: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>Psychosis is a mental state characterized by disorganized thinking or behavior; false beliefs, known as delusions; or false sights or sounds, known as hallucinations — doesn't typically get associated with depression.</li>
						<li>But most people having depression end up having psychotic symptoms</li>
					</ul>
				</li>	
				<li><b>Bipolar Disorder: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>Symptoms include high energy, excitement, racing thoughts, and poor judgment.</li>
						<li>Symptoms may cycle between depression and mania a few times per year or much more rapidly. </li>
						<li>This disorder has one of the highest risks for suicide.</li>
						<li>Bipolar disorder has four basic subtypes: bipolar I (characterized by at least one manic episode); bipolar II (characterized by hypomanic episodes — which are milderalong with depression); cyclothymic disorder; and other specified bipolar and related disorder.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>			
				<li><b>Situational Depression: </b>
					<ul>
