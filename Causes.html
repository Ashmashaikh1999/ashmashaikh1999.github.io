		<h2> Causes</h2>
		<center><img src="causes.jpg" align="center" height="320px" width="320px"></li><br><br></center>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Abuse: </b>Past physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can increase the vulnerability to clinical depression later in life.</li>
				<li><b>Certain medications: </b>Some drugs, such as isotretinoin (used to treat acne), the antiviral drug interferon-alpha, and corticosteroids, can increase your risk of depression.</li>
				<li><b>Conflict: </b>Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to develop depression may result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.</li>
				<li><b>Death or a loss: </b>Sadness or grief from the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, may increase the risk of depression.</li>
				<li><b>Genetics: </b>
					<ul><li>A family history of depression may increase the risk.</li> 
						<li>It's thought that depression is a complex trait, meaning that there are probably many different genes that each exert small effects, rather than a single gene that contributes to disease risk.</li>
						<li>The genetics of depression, like most psychiatric disorders, are not as simple or straightforward as in purely genetic diseases such as Huntington's chorea or cystic fibrosis.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Major events: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>Even good events such as starting a new job, graduating, or getting married can lead to depression.</li>
						<li>So can moving, losing a job or income, getting divorced, or retiring.</li>
						<li>However, the syndrome of clinical depression is never just a "normal" response to stressful life events.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Other personal problems: </b>Problems such as social isolation due to other mental illnesses or being cast out of a family or social group can contribute to the risk of developing clinical depression.</li>
			<li><b>Serious illnesses: </b>Sometimes depression co-exists with a major illness or may be triggered by another medical condition.</li>
			<li><b>Substance abuse: </b>
				<ul>
					<li>Nearly 30% of people with substance abuse problems also have major or clinical depression.</li>
					<li>Even if drugs or alcohol temporarily make you feel better, they ultimately will aggravate depression.</li>
				</ul>
